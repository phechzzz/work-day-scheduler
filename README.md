# Work Day Scheduler
This reactive work day scheduler displays hourly time blocks for the common 9-5 work day, color coding each time block according to past (grey), present(red), and future(green). Users can enter tasks or descriptions into each time block, which then will be saved and remain on screen when the page is refreshed.
## Why?
TThe purpose of this project was to practice using 3rd party web APIs and to continue working with local stoage.  Day.js was used to have a live time clock running, which in turn color coded each time block accordingly.
